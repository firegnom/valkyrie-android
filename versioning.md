# Versioning #

Version `x.y.z`

`x` - Major releases after exiting from beta stage this will gain 1

`y` - this number meens there were some enhancements done to the application it also may mean that protocol have changed there is big chance that version `0.4.x` won't work on server `0.5.x`    i am trying to keep 2 versions running at the same time but basically if there is a change in y application must be downloaded again from the market.

`z` - This are mostly bugfixes and small enchancements not very important for most of the users.


# Changes #

There are many changes done which don't require installing the application most of them are done inside [maps](MapDevelopment.md) new versions of the maps will be downloaded automatically from the server , There is also [scripting](scripting.md) environment which can change game play without need to update application . So most of the updates done to the world will be done in the background without need to update app.
